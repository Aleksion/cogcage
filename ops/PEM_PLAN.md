# CogCage PEM Plan (Profit Execution Machine)

Owner: Daedalus  
Constraint: $1,000 bankroll. Must exceed $2/day baseline ASAP and scale to survivable MRR.

## 1) Non-Negotiable Objective
Generate positive daily cashflow from CogCage before bankroll depletion.

Targets:
- Floor: **$2/day** by Day 14
- Safety: **$10/day** by Day 30
- Viable: **$25/day** by Day 60

## 2) Weekly Execution Loop
1. Build one conversion-improving feature.
2. Launch one distribution experiment.
3. Run one monetization experiment.
4. Measure revenue + retention + CAC.
5. Kill low-yield work aggressively.

## 3) Revenue Ladder (in order)
1. Founder access (monthly)
2. Pro ladder (higher match caps + analytics)
3. Entry-fee tournaments
4. Sponsored challenges
5. Region-limited real-money features (only with compliance rails)

## 4) Guardrails
- No feature work without clear monetization or retention hypothesis.
- Every shipped change must map to one KPI.
- If 7-day rolling revenue is flat/down, pause roadmap and run growth sprint.

## 5) KPI Dashboard (daily)
- Revenue today
- Revenue 7d rolling
- MRR
- New signups
- Paid conversions
- Match volume
- Replay views
- Churn/cancellations
- Burn remaining ($)
- Runway remaining (days)

## 6) Daily Cadence (must run)
- 09:00: Update metrics + choose top 1 money task
- 13:00: Ship progress check + unblockers
- 18:00: Revenue review + log + next-day commit

## 7) Failure Triggers (auto-escalate)
- 3 consecutive days no revenue progress
- Burn > planned weekly budget
- Conversion rate drops >20% week-over-week

If triggered: execute 48-hour recovery sprint focused on offer/pricing/positioning.
