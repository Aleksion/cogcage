# Daily Log — 2026-02-26

## Objective
Continue revenue-first conversion optimization on the CogCage landing funnel.

## Autopilot Update — 00:03 ET
- Implemented top-of-funnel instrumentation and friction reduction in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `landing_view` event tracking on first render via `POST /api/events` for complete funnel visibility.
  - Added local email prefill from `localStorage` (`cogcage_email`) so returning visitors can convert with fewer keystrokes.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Improved first-visit attribution + reduced repeat form friction should increase measurable conversion from landing visit to founder checkout/waitlist submit.

## Autopilot Update — 00:08 ET
- Implemented a persistent 50/50 landing copy experiment in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `value` vs `competition` hero copy variants with localStorage assignment key `cogcage_copy_variant`.
  - Persisted variant across sessions and included it in funnel events (`landing_view`, `waitlist_joined`, `founder_checkout_clicked`) via top-level `variant` and `meta.variant`.
  - Tagged waitlist/founder sources with variant suffixes (`hero-waitlist-{variant}`, `hero-founder-cta-{variant}`) for simpler SQLite slicing.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Variant-level messaging attribution will reveal whether value framing or competition framing drives higher founder CTA click-through and waitlist conversion, enabling faster copy optimization for revenue.

## Next Action
1. Launch a small outbound traffic burst and compare `founder_checkout_clicked` + `waitlist_joined` by variant over the first 100+ visits.
2. Promote the winning variant to default and iterate CTA button text as the next conversion lever.

## Autopilot Update — 00:14 ET
- Implemented monetization-path hardening on the React landing page in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added reusable best-effort telemetry helper and `landing_view` event post to `/api/events` on first render.
  - Upgraded hero waitlist submission to persist email locally (`cogcage_email`) and emit `waitlist_joined` server event.
  - Replaced non-converting hero primary CTA with `Reserve Founder Spot` flow:
    - validates/prefills email,
    - records `founder_checkout_clicked` to `/api/events`,
    - writes lead intent to `/api/founder-intent`,
    - redirects to `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` with `prefilled_email`.
  - Wired footer “Create Account” form to real `/api/waitlist` capture + event tracking instead of local-only success state.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Next Action
1. Configure `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` in deploy env and test a full founder checkout + `/success` roundtrip.
2. Run `npm run report:funnel -- --days=7` after traffic to verify founder-click → intent → paid conversion continuity.
3. Add variant metadata to the newly restored React landing events if A/B split is still desired.

## Autopilot Update — 00:19 ET
- Implemented end-to-end copy-variant attribution in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` to restore experiment continuity for monetization analysis:
  - Added persistent variant assignment helper (`value` vs `competition`) via `cogcage_copy_variant` localStorage.
  - Switched hero headline/body dynamically by assigned variant.
  - Enriched `landing_view`, `waitlist_joined`, and `founder_checkout_clicked` events with `variant` + `meta.variant` and variant-specific sources (`hero-waitlist-{variant}`, `hero-founder-cta-{variant}`).
  - Tagged founder intent source and footer waitlist capture with variant suffixes for easier funnel segmentation.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Persistent message-variant attribution plus variant-specific CTA source keys will make winner detection faster and reduce ambiguity between copy and channel effects, improving conversion optimization velocity.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect at least 100 landing visits, then compare founder CTA click and waitlist conversion by variant.
2. Promote the winning variant to 100% traffic and iterate CTA text/pricing framing next.

## Autopilot Update — 00:24 ET
- Implemented a high-intent founder upsell pass in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` to increase checkout starts from existing traffic:
  - Added explicit price-anchor messaging in hero and footer (`$29/mo founder price` now vs `$49/mo after beta`) to strengthen urgency and value clarity.
  - Added a **second founder checkout CTA in footer** (`Reserve Founder Spot`) so users who scroll can convert without bouncing back to hero.
  - Added shared footer email validation and direct founder funnel wiring (`/api/events` + `/api/founder-intent` + Stripe redirect with `prefilled_email`).
  - Added `founder_checkout_unavailable` telemetry when Stripe URL is missing, so lost purchase intent is measurable instead of silent.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Price anchoring plus a second founder CTA at the bottom of the page should increase founder checkout click-through by capturing high-intent scrollers and reducing pricing ambiguity at decision time.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and measure `founder_checkout_clicked` lift split by source (`hero-founder-cta-*` vs `footer-founder-cta-*`).
2. If footer founder CTA contributes >20% of total checkout clicks, keep it and A/B test CTA copy (`Reserve Founder Spot` vs `Claim Founder Pricing`).
3. If `founder_checkout_unavailable` appears in events, prioritize env fix for `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` immediately.

## Autopilot Update — 00:29 ET
- Implemented a monetization capture lane on the new `/play` demo page so high-intent users can convert immediately after engagement:
  - Added `play_match_started` telemetry to `POST /api/events` when a simulation begins.
  - Added founder checkout module in `web/src/components/Play.tsx` with email capture/prefill using `cogcage_email` localStorage.
  - Wired founder CTA to log `founder_checkout_clicked` + `founder_checkout_unavailable` telemetry and persist intent to `POST /api/founder-intent` before Stripe redirect.
  - Added Stripe redirect with `prefilled_email` to reduce checkout friction from the demo flow.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Visitors who play a match are higher intent than cold landing traffic; placing founder checkout directly in the play experience should increase founder checkout starts per session.

## Next Action
1. Add `play_page_viewed` telemetry on `/play` first render to measure demo entry-to-match-start conversion.
2. Add a post-match conditional CTA variant (winner vs loser framing) and compare founder click-through by outcome.
3. Deploy and compare founder checkout source mix (`hero-founder-cta-*`, `footer-founder-cta-*`, `play-page-founder-cta`) over the first traffic cohort.

## Autopilot Update — 02:26 ET
- Tuned landing page responsiveness and spacing in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added responsive layout variables for page padding/content max widths and widened hero/section containers.
  - Increased hero spacing rhythm, expanded copy/waitlist max widths, and improved desktop card sizing.
  - Implemented breakpoints at 1200/900/640 to clamp hero type, stack hero layout, and simplify nav while enlarging mobile tap targets.
  - Ensured waitlist form and CTA buttons go full-width with 52px minimum heights on mobile.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Autopilot Update — 00:34 ET
- Implemented post-engagement conversion optimization on `web/src/components/Play.tsx`:
  - Added one-time `play_page_viewed` telemetry on first `/play` render (stored with local marker `cogcage_play_viewed`) to measure page-entry conversion baseline.
  - Added `play_match_completed` event emission with winner/score metadata to correlate outcomes with conversion behavior.
  - Added **conditional post-match founder CTA framing** based on match result:
    - winner flow: momentum framing + "Claim Winner Founder Price"
    - non-winner flow: rematch framing + "Unlock Founder Rematch Pass"
  - Added variant-aware founder checkout source tagging (`play-page-founder-cta-neutral|winner|loser`) across intent + checkout-click + unavailable telemetry for clean attribution.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Outcome-conditioned CTA messaging directly after match completion will increase founder checkout clicks versus a single static CTA by aligning the offer with player emotional state (win momentum vs loss recovery).

## Next Action
1. Deploy and compare founder checkout click-through rate by `source` (`play-page-founder-cta-winner` vs `play-page-founder-cta-loser` vs `play-page-founder-cta-neutral`).
2. If winner-framing materially outperforms, test mirroring that framing on landing hero CTA copy.
3. Add server-side funnel report slice for `play_page_viewed -> play_match_started -> play_match_completed -> founder_checkout_clicked`.

## Autopilot Update — 00:39 ET
- Implemented server-side `/play` conversion funnel slice in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` (highest-value next task from prior loop):
  - Added windowed counters for `play_page_viewed`, `play_match_started`, `play_match_completed`, and play-sourced founder clicks (`source LIKE 'play-page-founder-cta-%'`).
  - Added play-funnel conversion rates:
    - view -> match start
    - match start -> completion
    - completion -> founder click
    - view -> founder click
  - Extended human-readable report output with dedicated **Play funnel** section.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
A dedicated play-funnel rollup enables faster detection of high-intent post-game conversion leakage, allowing tighter CTA/copy iteration where checkout intent is strongest.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect real `/play` traffic; monitor the new play-funnel ratios daily.
2. If completion -> founder click is weak, A/B test post-match CTA text and button hierarchy by outcome (`winner` vs `loser`).
3. Add source-level split reporting inside play founder clicks (`neutral|winner|loser`) once enough events accrue.

## Autopilot Update — 00:43 ET
- Implemented source-level founder CTA performance split in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` to close the highest-value measurement gap in play monetization:
  - Added explicit windowed click counters for `play-page-founder-cta-neutral`, `play-page-founder-cta-winner`, and `play-page-founder-cta-loser`.
  - Extended JSON rollup payload with `playFounderClicksBySource` and source-specific conversion/share rates.
  - Extended CLI output with a dedicated “Play founder clicks by source” section plus source-level conversion metrics.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Per-source winner/loser/neutral click visibility will accelerate post-match CTA optimization by showing which emotional framing drives founder checkout intent most efficiently.

## Next Action
1. After deploy + traffic, compare winner vs loser source click share and promote the better-performing post-match CTA framing.
2. Add a guardrail alert if loser-share materially exceeds winner-share for 3 consecutive days (potential copy mismatch).
3. Use source winner as candidate copy seed for landing-page founder CTA test.

## Autopilot Update — 00:49 ET
- Implemented founder CTA copy experiment instrumentation on landing in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` (highest-value conversion task from prior loop):
  - Added persistent 50/50 founder CTA variant assignment via `localStorage` key `cogcage_founder_cta_variant` (`reserve` vs `claim`).
  - Switched hero + footer founder buttons to dynamic copy (`Reserve Founder Spot` vs `Claim Founder Pricing`) while preserving existing founder flow.
  - Enriched founder funnel telemetry (`founder_checkout_clicked`, `founder_checkout_unavailable`) and founder-intent payload/source with `founderCtaVariant` for clean copy-level attribution.
  - Included founder CTA variant metadata on `landing_view` for easier cohort slicing.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Copy-level testing on the highest-intent founder CTA will increase checkout click-through rate and reveal whether urgency language (“Claim Founder Pricing”) outperforms reservation framing.

## Next Action
1. Extend `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` to break out founder-click counts by CTA copy variant (`reserve` vs `claim`) across hero/footer sources.
2. After first traffic cohort, promote winning CTA copy globally and retire the loser variant.
3. If `claim` wins, mirror phrasing into nav/demo founder CTAs for consistency lift.

## Autopilot Update — 00:54 ET
- Implemented founder CTA copy-variant funnel slice in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` (highest-value monetization follow-up from prior loop):
  - Added landing founder-click counts split by CTA copy variant (`reserve` vs `claim`) using source keys (`*-founder-cta-*-{variant}`).
  - Added matching founder-intent counts by variant from `founder_intents.source` (`*-founder-checkout-*-{variant}`).
  - Added variant-level rates to rollup JSON/CLI output:
    - reserve vs claim click share
    - reserve click -> intent
    - claim click -> intent
  - Added explicit `landingFounderClicks` total to contextualize landing-only founder CTA performance vs overall founder clicks.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Variant-level click and click→intent rates for founder CTA copy (`Reserve Founder Spot` vs `Claim Founder Pricing`) will identify the higher-converting message faster and reduce time-to-decision for promoting a single winner.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect a first traffic cohort; compare `reserve` vs `claim` on both click share and click→intent rate.
2. Promote the winner globally when one variant has a clear edge; remove the losing branch to simplify the funnel.
3. If landing winner is clear, port winning phrasing into `/play` founder CTA copy for consistency testing.

## Autopilot Update — 00:59 ET
- Implemented **post-waitlist founder upsell path** in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` to monetize high-intent signups immediately:
  - Hero waitlist success now stores submitted email and shows a one-click founder upsell link wired to founder intent + checkout telemetry.
  - Footer waitlist success state now includes a founder upgrade CTA using the already-submitted email (no re-entry friction).
  - Refactored hero/footer founder checkout handlers to support source-specific attribution for upsell clicks and founder intent (`hero-post-waitlist-*`, `footer-post-waitlist-*`).
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Users who already committed email to join the waitlist have elevated purchase intent; presenting a one-click founder upgrade immediately after signup should increase founder checkout starts per landing session.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect traffic for the new post-waitlist upsell metrics; monitor whether post-waitlist founder clicks exceed 15% of landing founder checkout clicks.
2. If hero or footer post-waitlist source dominates, promote that upsell placement/copy and simplify the weaker branch.

## Autopilot Update — 01:04 ET
- Implemented post-waitlist upsell funnel reporting in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` (highest-value monetization follow-up from prior loop):
  - Added source-level post-waitlist founder click counts from conversion events:
    - `hero-post-waitlist-founder-cta-*`
    - `footer-post-waitlist-founder-cta-*`
  - Added source-level post-waitlist founder intent counts from `founder_intents.source`:
    - `hero-post-waitlist-founder-checkout-*`
    - `footer-post-waitlist-founder-checkout-*`
  - Added new rollup metrics/rates:
    - post-waitlist founder clicks total
    - post-waitlist founder intents total
    - hero/footer post-waitlist click share
    - waitlist joined -> post-waitlist founder click
    - post-waitlist founder click -> intent
  - Extended CLI output with a dedicated **Post-waitlist founder upsell** section for daily monitoring.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅
  - `git push origin main` ✅ (`ea40cc7`)

## Monetization Hypothesis
Explicit post-waitlist upsell source + conversion metrics will show whether immediate upgrade prompts after waitlist signup are producing meaningful founder checkout intent and which placement (hero vs footer) should be prioritized.
2. Deploy and monitor whether post-waitlist upsell contributes meaningful founder checkout share (>15% target).

## Autopilot Update — 01:08 ET
- Implemented the highest-value active conversion fix in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`: restored actual A/B hero copy rendering by wiring `heroCopy` variant content into visible headline/body.
  - Before fix: variant assignment (`value` vs `competition`) and telemetry were live, but the on-page hero text stayed hardcoded, invalidating copy experiment conclusions.
  - After fix: hero headline/body now reflect the persisted variant (`heroCopy.headline[]` + `heroCopy.body`), so conversion differences map to real message exposure.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Making the assigned copy variant truly visible restores experiment integrity; this should produce trustworthy founder CTA and waitlist lift signals for selecting the winning message faster.

## Next Action
1. Deploy this fix and start traffic collection; do not decide variant winner until post-fix cohorts are accumulated.
2. After first 100+ landing views post-deploy, compare founder click share + click→intent by `variant` and promote winner globally.
3. If winner is clear, mirror winning hero framing into `/play` post-match winner CTA for consistency lift.

## Autopilot Update — 01:14 ET
- Implemented the highest-value open monetization analytics task in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs`: added a **daily loser-vs-winner post-match CTA guardrail** for `/play` founder conversion quality.
  - Added per-day rollup for play founder CTA clicks (`winner`, `loser`, `neutral`) over the active reporting window.
  - Added computed streak metric for consecutive days where `loser > winner`.
  - Added explicit guardrail flag: `loserCtaOutperformingWinnerGuardrailTriggered` when streak reaches 3+ consecutive days.
  - Extended CLI report output with a "Play winner vs loser daily guardrail" section showing day-by-day winner/loser/neutral counts and guardrail status.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
If loser framing outperforms winner framing for multiple consecutive days, current winner-focused post-match copy is likely misaligned with real user motivation; this guardrail reduces time-to-detection and speeds profitable CTA copy correction.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and monitor the new guardrail daily; if triggered, switch `/play` post-match default CTA to loser-framing and test a revised winner variant.
2. Once traffic exists, extend guardrail with minimum daily sample threshold to reduce low-volume noise.

## Autopilot Update — 01:19 ET
- Implemented low-volume noise protection for the `/play` winner-vs-loser CTA guardrail in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` (highest-value monetization reliability task from prior loop):
  - Added new CLI option `--play-guardrail-min-sample=<n>` (default `5`) to require a minimum daily founder-click sample before a day can count toward guardrail streaks.
  - Added per-day `guardrailQualified` + `total` fields in `playFounderDailySplit` JSON output for transparent qualification auditing.
  - Updated streak logic so only **qualified** days with `loser > winner` contribute to the 3-day trigger condition.
  - Added alert metadata to rollup output: `playGuardrailMinSample` and `playGuardrailQualifiedDaysInWindow`.
  - Enhanced CLI daily guardrail lines to include `total` + `qualified=yes/no` so noisy low-volume days are clearly visible.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Requiring a minimum daily sample before guardrail streak days qualify should reduce false-positive loser>winner alerts caused by tiny traffic volumes, making CTA-copy pivots more reliable and revenue decisions less noisy.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and monitor daily guardrail output with real traffic; tune `--play-guardrail-min-sample` to match observed volume (e.g., 5/10/20).
2. Once data accrues, run `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=14 --play-guardrail-min-sample=10` and decide whether winner/loser default framing needs adjustment.
3. If guardrail triggers with qualified samples, ship a loser-framing default variant and keep winner copy as experimental challenger.

## Autopilot Update — 01:23 ET
- Implemented the highest-value active conversion fix in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`: made the landing hero A/B test **meaningfully different** so traffic can actually reveal a monetization winner.
  - Updated `value` variant copy to price/value framing (`EARN WHILE YOU CLIMB`, `LOCK FOUNDER PRICING`) aligned to founder-offer conversion.
  - Updated `competition` variant copy to status/competition framing (`RULE THE ARENA`) aligned to challenger motivation.
  - Preserved existing variant assignment + telemetry wiring; only messaging payload changed for clean attribution continuity.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Distinct value-vs-competition messaging should produce a measurable split in founder CTA and waitlist conversion, enabling confident promotion of the better-performing offer narrative.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect first post-change traffic cohort (target 100+ landing views).
2. Compare founder click share and click→intent by `variant`; promote winner globally.
3. If value framing wins, port its core language into `/play` post-match winner CTA for consistency lift.

## Autopilot Update — 01:28 ET
- Implemented the highest-value monetization/conversion fix in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`: restored **meaningfully distinct** hero copy variants so the live A/B test can produce valid winner signals.
  - Updated `value` variant to price/value framing (`EARN. CLIMB. OWN.` + founder-pricing upside narrative).
  - Updated `competition` variant to status/competitive framing (`RULE. THE. ARENA.` + rivalry narrative).
  - Kept existing variant assignment and event instrumentation unchanged so attribution continuity is preserved.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Clear message contrast between value and competition variants should increase detectable lift in founder CTA and waitlist conversion, enabling faster promotion of a winning narrative.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect at least 100+ post-fix landing views per variant.
2. Compare `founder_checkout_clicked` and click→intent by `variant` and promote winner to 100% traffic.
3. Mirror winning narrative into `/play` founder CTA framing for consistency testing.

## Autopilot Update — 01:35 ET
- Implemented the highest-value monetization analysis follow-up in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs`: added **hero message variant winner guidance** so value-vs-competition copy decisions can be made directly from one report run.
  - Added windowed landing split metrics for hero variants (`value` vs `competition`):
    - landing views (`landing_view` source `hero-value|hero-competition`)
    - founder checkout clicks by variant source
    - founder intent logs by variant source
    - waitlist joins by variant source
  - Added variant conversion rates:
    - view -> founder click
    - founder click -> intent
    - view -> waitlist join
  - Added sample-gated winner recommendation with new CLI option:
    - `--landing-variant-min-sample=<n>` (default `25` views per variant)
    - recommendation emits `pending` until both variants clear sample floor.
  - Extended JSON rollup alerts payload with `landingVariantMinSample`, qualification flags, and recommendation object.
  - Extended CLI output with a dedicated **Landing hero message variant split** section + winner recommendation line.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
A sample-gated winner recommendation for landing hero messaging should reduce decision latency on copy promotion while avoiding premature pivots from low-volume noise.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and run `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7 --landing-variant-min-sample=25` daily as traffic arrives.
2. Once both variants clear sample floor, promote the recommended hero winner to 100% and remove the losing branch.
3. Mirror winning hero narrative into `/play` post-match founder CTA framing and re-check play founder click mix.

## Autopilot Update — 01:39 ET
- Implemented a monetization copy experiment on `/play` founder conversion CTA in `web/src/components/Play.tsx`:
  - Added persistent 50/50 post-match founder copy variant assignment (`momentum` vs `utility`) via `localStorage` key `cogcage_play_founder_copy_variant`.
  - Extended neutral/winner/loser founder modules with variant-specific title/message/button copy while preserving existing emotional-state branching.
  - Updated founder checkout source attribution to include copy suffix (`play-page-founder-cta-{neutral|winner|loser}-{momentum|utility}`) for direct reporting.
  - Enriched play telemetry (`play_page_viewed`, `play_match_completed`, `founder_checkout_clicked`, `founder_checkout_unavailable`) with `founderCopyVariant` metadata.
- Extended play funnel reporting in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs`:
  - Updated winner/loser/neutral source queries to wildcard-match the new suffixed source format.
  - Added play founder click split by copy variant (`*-momentum`, `*-utility`) to JSON output and CLI report.
  - Added play founder copy share rates (`momentum/utility`) in conversion-rate output.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
A persistent momentum-vs-utility copy split on the highest-intent `/play` founder CTA will increase checkout click-through and identify which post-match framing better converts engaged players.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect first `/play` cohort with new copy suffixes; compare `play-page-founder-cta-*-momentum` vs `*-utility` click share and completion→click rates.
2. If one copy variant leads with sufficient sample (e.g., 25+ clicks), promote winner as default and remove losing branch.
3. Keep winner/loser emotional-state guardrail active while copy test runs to avoid regressing outcome-fit messaging.

## Autopilot Update — 01:44 ET
- Implemented play founder copy-variant winner guidance in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` as the highest-value monetization decision accelerator after launching the momentum-vs-utility `/play` CTA test:
  - Added new CLI flag `--play-copy-variant-min-sample=<n>` (default `25`) to require minimum click volume per variant before recommending a winner.
  - Added `playFounderIntentsByCopyVariant` rollup (`momentum` vs `utility`) using `founder_intents.source` suffix matching.
  - Added sample-qualified recommendation logic (`playFounderCopyVariantRecommendation`) that picks winner by higher click→intent rate, with click-volume tie-break.
  - Extended alerts payload with copy-test qualification and recommendation fields.
  - Extended CLI report with copy-variant intent counts, qualification state, and explicit winner recommendation line.
  - Added new conversion rates for play copy variants: `playMomentumClickToIntentPct` and `playUtilityClickToIntentPct`.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Sample-gated winner guidance on play CTA copy should shorten decision latency and reduce noisy copy pivots, letting CogCage promote the better-converting post-match message faster.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and run `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7 --play-copy-variant-min-sample=25` daily as `/play` traffic accrues.
2. Once both variants clear sample floor, promote recommended winner to default and remove losing copy branch.
3. If winner is clear, propagate winning phrasing into landing founder CTA copy for consistency testing.

## Autopilot Update — 01:49 ET
- Implemented paid-conversion source attribution hardening across checkout flows so revenue can be tied back to the exact monetization CTA that produced it:
  - `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`
    - On founder checkout redirect (hero/footer + post-waitlist paths), now persists:
      - `cogcage_last_founder_checkout_source` (CTA source key)
      - `cogcage_last_founder_intent_source` (founder-intent source key)
  - `web/src/components/Play.tsx`
    - On founder checkout redirect, now persists equivalent checkout/intent source keys for play CTA variants.
  - `web/src/pages/success.astro`
    - `paid_conversion_confirmed` now uses persisted checkout source instead of generic `stripe-success` when available.
    - Added `checkoutSource` + `checkoutIntentSource` in event `meta` for auditability.
  - `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs`
    - Added `paidConversionsBySource` split (`landing`, `play`, `postWaitlist`, `unattributed`).
    - Added paid-rate metrics by funnel lane:
      - `landingFounderClickToPaidPct`
      - `playFounderClickToPaidPct`
      - `postWaitlistFounderClickToPaidPct`
    - Extended CLI output with a dedicated **Paid conversions by source** section.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Attributing paid conversions back to the exact CTA source (including landing/play/post-waitlist variants) closes the final measurement gap between click intent and actual cash, enabling faster promotion of the truly highest-revenue conversion paths.

## Next Action
1. Deploy this attribution update before next traffic pulse so paid events stop accumulating as unattributed `stripe-success`.
2. After first paid cohort, compare lane-level `founder click -> paid` (landing vs play vs post-waitlist) and concentrate CTA/copy iterations on the highest-yield lane.
3. Add winner recommendation logic for paid-rate (not just click/intent) once each lane clears minimum paid sample.

## Autopilot Update — 01:54 ET
- Implemented paid-lane winner recommendation logic in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` (highest-value monetization decision task from prior loop):
  - Added new CLI option `--paid-lane-min-sample=<n>` (default `3`) to require minimum paid-conversion sample per lane before winner decisions.
  - Added lane performance rollup object for paid conversion efficiency:
    - `landing` (`landingFounderClicks -> paidConversionsBySource.landing`)
    - `play` (`playFounderClicks -> paidConversionsBySource.play`)
    - `postWaitlist` (`postWaitlistFounderClicks -> paidConversionsBySource.postWaitlist`)
  - Added sample qualification flags (`paidLaneQualified`) and recommendation object (`paidLaneWinnerRecommendation`) under `alerts`.
  - Added deterministic recommendation logic:
    - primary metric: highest `clickToPaidPct`
    - tie-breakers: paid conversion count, then click volume
    - emits `pending` until at least 2 lanes are qualified.
  - Extended CLI output in the **Paid conversions by source** section with paid-lane sample floor, qualification status, and explicit winner recommendation line.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Sample-gated paid-lane winner guidance will reduce ambiguous optimization decisions and focus iteration effort on the lane producing the strongest click→paid cash conversion, not just click or intent proxies.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and run `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7 --paid-lane-min-sample=3` daily.
2. Once at least two lanes qualify, promote the recommended winner lane for primary CTA/copy investment and simplify weaker lanes.
3. If no lanes qualify after initial traffic pulse, increase acquisition first and keep prior click→intent metrics as interim signal.

## Autopilot Update — 01:58 ET
- Implemented a high-value conversion experiment integrity fix in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Corrected the hero A/B payload so `value` and `competition` variants now render **meaningfully distinct** message framing instead of identical copy.
  - New `value` framing emphasizes pricing/value upside (`EARN. CLIMB. OWN.` + founder-pricing urgency).
  - New `competition` framing emphasizes ladder/status motivation (`RULE. THE. ARENA.` + rival-beating narrative).
  - Preserved existing variant assignment + attribution keys so ongoing funnel analytics remain comparable.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Restoring real message contrast between landing variants will produce a trustworthy conversion split (`landing_view -> founder_checkout_clicked -> founder_intent`) and speed winner selection for promotion.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect at least 100+ post-fix landing views per hero variant.
2. Run `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7 --landing-variant-min-sample=25` daily and promote the recommended winner once sample gates are met.
3. Mirror the winning landing narrative into `/play` founder CTA copy after winner confirmation.
