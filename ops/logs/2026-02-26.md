## Objective
Continue revenue-first conversion optimization on the CogCage landing funnel.

## Autopilot Update — 00:03 ET
- Implemented top-of-funnel instrumentation and friction reduction in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `landing_view` event tracking on first render via `POST /api/events` for complete funnel visibility.
  - Added local email prefill from `localStorage` (`cogcage_email`) so returning visitors can convert with fewer keystrokes.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Improved first-visit attribution + reduced repeat form friction should increase measurable conversion from landing visit to founder checkout/waitlist submit.

## Autopilot Update — 00:08 ET
- Implemented a persistent 50/50 landing copy experiment in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `value` vs `competition` hero copy variants with localStorage assignment key `cogcage_copy_variant`.
  - Persisted variant across sessions and included it in funnel events (`landing_view`, `waitlist_joined`, `founder_checkout_clicked`) via top-level `variant` and `meta.variant`.
  - Tagged waitlist/founder sources with variant suffixes (`hero-waitlist-{variant}`, `hero-founder-cta-{variant}`) for simpler SQLite slicing.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Variant-level messaging attribution will reveal whether value framing or competition framing drives higher founder CTA click-through and waitlist conversion, enabling faster copy optimization for revenue.

## Next Action
1. Launch a small outbound traffic burst and compare `founder_checkout_clicked` + `waitlist_joined` by variant over the first 100+ visits.
2. Promote the winning variant to default and iterate CTA button text as the next conversion lever.

## Autopilot Update — 00:14 ET
- Implemented monetization-path hardening on the React landing page in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added reusable best-effort telemetry helper and `landing_view` event post to `/api/events` on first render.
  - Upgraded hero waitlist submission to persist email locally (`cogcage_email`) and emit `waitlist_joined` server event.
  - Replaced non-converting hero primary CTA with `Reserve Founder Spot` flow:
    - validates/prefills email,
    - records `founder_checkout_clicked` to `/api/events`,
    - writes lead intent to `/api/founder-intent`,
    - redirects to `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` with `prefilled_email`.
  - Wired footer “Create Account” form to real `/api/waitlist` capture + event tracking instead of local-only success state.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Next Action
1. Configure `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` in deploy env and test a full founder checkout + `/success` roundtrip.
2. Run `npm run report:funnel -- --days=7` after traffic to verify founder-click → intent → paid conversion continuity.
3. Add variant metadata to the newly restored React landing events if A/B split is still desired.

## Autopilot Update — 00:19 ET
- Implemented end-to-end copy-variant attribution in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` to restore experiment continuity for monetization analysis:
  - Added persistent variant assignment helper (`value` vs `competition`) via `cogcage_copy_variant` localStorage.
  - Switched hero headline/body dynamically by assigned variant.
  - Enriched `landing_view`, `waitlist_joined`, and `founder_checkout_clicked` events with `variant` + `meta.variant` and variant-specific sources (`hero-waitlist-{variant}`, `hero-founder-cta-{variant}`).
  - Tagged founder intent source and footer waitlist capture with variant suffixes for easier funnel segmentation.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Persistent message-variant attribution plus variant-specific CTA source keys will make winner detection faster and reduce ambiguity between copy and channel effects, improving conversion optimization velocity.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect at least 100 landing visits, then compare founder CTA click and waitlist conversion by variant.
2. Promote the winning variant to 100% traffic and iterate CTA text/pricing framing next.
