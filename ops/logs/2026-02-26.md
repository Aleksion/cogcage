## Objective
Continue revenue-first conversion optimization on the CogCage landing funnel.

## Autopilot Update — 00:03 ET
- Implemented top-of-funnel instrumentation and friction reduction in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `landing_view` event tracking on first render via `POST /api/events` for complete funnel visibility.
  - Added local email prefill from `localStorage` (`cogcage_email`) so returning visitors can convert with fewer keystrokes.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Improved first-visit attribution + reduced repeat form friction should increase measurable conversion from landing visit to founder checkout/waitlist submit.

## Next Action
1. Add a lightweight weekly A/B copy toggle (value framing vs. competition framing) and persist variant in conversion events.
2. Run first outbound traffic burst and compare founder click-through by variant.
