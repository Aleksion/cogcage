# Daily Log — 2026-02-26

## Objective
Continue revenue-first conversion optimization on the CogCage landing funnel.

## Autopilot Update — 00:03 ET
- Implemented top-of-funnel instrumentation and friction reduction in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `landing_view` event tracking on first render via `POST /api/events` for complete funnel visibility.
  - Added local email prefill from `localStorage` (`cogcage_email`) so returning visitors can convert with fewer keystrokes.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Improved first-visit attribution + reduced repeat form friction should increase measurable conversion from landing visit to founder checkout/waitlist submit.

## Autopilot Update — 00:08 ET
- Implemented a persistent 50/50 landing copy experiment in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `value` vs `competition` hero copy variants with localStorage assignment key `cogcage_copy_variant`.
  - Persisted variant across sessions and included it in funnel events (`landing_view`, `waitlist_joined`, `founder_checkout_clicked`) via top-level `variant` and `meta.variant`.
  - Tagged waitlist/founder sources with variant suffixes (`hero-waitlist-{variant}`, `hero-founder-cta-{variant}`) for simpler SQLite slicing.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Variant-level messaging attribution will reveal whether value framing or competition framing drives higher founder CTA click-through and waitlist conversion, enabling faster copy optimization for revenue.

## Next Action
1. Launch a small outbound traffic burst and compare `founder_checkout_clicked` + `waitlist_joined` by variant over the first 100+ visits.
2. Promote the winning variant to default and iterate CTA button text as the next conversion lever.

## Autopilot Update — 00:14 ET
- Implemented monetization-path hardening on the React landing page in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added reusable best-effort telemetry helper and `landing_view` event post to `/api/events` on first render.
  - Upgraded hero waitlist submission to persist email locally (`cogcage_email`) and emit `waitlist_joined` server event.
  - Replaced non-converting hero primary CTA with `Reserve Founder Spot` flow:
    - validates/prefills email,
    - records `founder_checkout_clicked` to `/api/events`,
    - writes lead intent to `/api/founder-intent`,
    - redirects to `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` with `prefilled_email`.
  - Wired footer “Create Account” form to real `/api/waitlist` capture + event tracking instead of local-only success state.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Next Action
1. Configure `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` in deploy env and test a full founder checkout + `/success` roundtrip.
2. Run `npm run report:funnel -- --days=7` after traffic to verify founder-click → intent → paid conversion continuity.
3. Add variant metadata to the newly restored React landing events if A/B split is still desired.

## Autopilot Update — 00:19 ET
- Implemented end-to-end copy-variant attribution in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` to restore experiment continuity for monetization analysis:
  - Added persistent variant assignment helper (`value` vs `competition`) via `cogcage_copy_variant` localStorage.
  - Switched hero headline/body dynamically by assigned variant.
  - Enriched `landing_view`, `waitlist_joined`, and `founder_checkout_clicked` events with `variant` + `meta.variant` and variant-specific sources (`hero-waitlist-{variant}`, `hero-founder-cta-{variant}`).
  - Tagged founder intent source and footer waitlist capture with variant suffixes for easier funnel segmentation.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Persistent message-variant attribution plus variant-specific CTA source keys will make winner detection faster and reduce ambiguity between copy and channel effects, improving conversion optimization velocity.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect at least 100 landing visits, then compare founder CTA click and waitlist conversion by variant.
2. Promote the winning variant to 100% traffic and iterate CTA text/pricing framing next.

## Autopilot Update — 00:24 ET
- Implemented a high-intent founder upsell pass in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` to increase checkout starts from existing traffic:
  - Added explicit price-anchor messaging in hero and footer (`$29/mo founder price` now vs `$49/mo after beta`) to strengthen urgency and value clarity.
  - Added a **second founder checkout CTA in footer** (`Reserve Founder Spot`) so users who scroll can convert without bouncing back to hero.
  - Added shared footer email validation and direct founder funnel wiring (`/api/events` + `/api/founder-intent` + Stripe redirect with `prefilled_email`).
  - Added `founder_checkout_unavailable` telemetry when Stripe URL is missing, so lost purchase intent is measurable instead of silent.
- Validation: `cd web && npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Price anchoring plus a second founder CTA at the bottom of the page should increase founder checkout click-through by capturing high-intent scrollers and reducing pricing ambiguity at decision time.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and measure `founder_checkout_clicked` lift split by source (`hero-founder-cta-*` vs `footer-founder-cta-*`).
2. If footer founder CTA contributes >20% of total checkout clicks, keep it and A/B test CTA copy (`Reserve Founder Spot` vs `Claim Founder Pricing`).
3. If `founder_checkout_unavailable` appears in events, prioritize env fix for `PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL` immediately.

## Autopilot Update — 00:29 ET
- Implemented a monetization capture lane on the new `/play` demo page so high-intent users can convert immediately after engagement:
  - Added `play_match_started` telemetry to `POST /api/events` when a simulation begins.
  - Added founder checkout module in `web/src/components/Play.tsx` with email capture/prefill using `cogcage_email` localStorage.
  - Wired founder CTA to log `founder_checkout_clicked` + `founder_checkout_unavailable` telemetry and persist intent to `POST /api/founder-intent` before Stripe redirect.
  - Added Stripe redirect with `prefilled_email` to reduce checkout friction from the demo flow.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Visitors who play a match are higher intent than cold landing traffic; placing founder checkout directly in the play experience should increase founder checkout starts per session.

## Next Action
1. Add `play_page_viewed` telemetry on `/play` first render to measure demo entry-to-match-start conversion.
2. Add a post-match conditional CTA variant (winner vs loser framing) and compare founder click-through by outcome.
3. Deploy and compare founder checkout source mix (`hero-founder-cta-*`, `footer-founder-cta-*`, `play-page-founder-cta`) over the first traffic cohort.

## Autopilot Update — 02:26 ET
- Tuned landing page responsiveness and spacing in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added responsive layout variables for page padding/content max widths and widened hero/section containers.
  - Increased hero spacing rhythm, expanded copy/waitlist max widths, and improved desktop card sizing.
  - Implemented breakpoints at 1200/900/640 to clamp hero type, stack hero layout, and simplify nav while enlarging mobile tap targets.
  - Ensured waitlist form and CTA buttons go full-width with 52px minimum heights on mobile.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Autopilot Update — 00:34 ET
- Implemented post-engagement conversion optimization on `web/src/components/Play.tsx`:
  - Added one-time `play_page_viewed` telemetry on first `/play` render (stored with local marker `cogcage_play_viewed`) to measure page-entry conversion baseline.
  - Added `play_match_completed` event emission with winner/score metadata to correlate outcomes with conversion behavior.
  - Added **conditional post-match founder CTA framing** based on match result:
    - winner flow: momentum framing + "Claim Winner Founder Price"
    - non-winner flow: rematch framing + "Unlock Founder Rematch Pass"
  - Added variant-aware founder checkout source tagging (`play-page-founder-cta-neutral|winner|loser`) across intent + checkout-click + unavailable telemetry for clean attribution.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Outcome-conditioned CTA messaging directly after match completion will increase founder checkout clicks versus a single static CTA by aligning the offer with player emotional state (win momentum vs loss recovery).

## Next Action
1. Deploy and compare founder checkout click-through rate by `source` (`play-page-founder-cta-winner` vs `play-page-founder-cta-loser` vs `play-page-founder-cta-neutral`).
2. If winner-framing materially outperforms, test mirroring that framing on landing hero CTA copy.
3. Add server-side funnel report slice for `play_page_viewed -> play_match_started -> play_match_completed -> founder_checkout_clicked`.

## Autopilot Update — 00:39 ET
- Implemented server-side `/play` conversion funnel slice in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` (highest-value next task from prior loop):
  - Added windowed counters for `play_page_viewed`, `play_match_started`, `play_match_completed`, and play-sourced founder clicks (`source LIKE 'play-page-founder-cta-%'`).
  - Added play-funnel conversion rates:
    - view -> match start
    - match start -> completion
    - completion -> founder click
    - view -> founder click
  - Extended human-readable report output with dedicated **Play funnel** section.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
A dedicated play-funnel rollup enables faster detection of high-intent post-game conversion leakage, allowing tighter CTA/copy iteration where checkout intent is strongest.

## Next Action
1. Deploy and collect real `/play` traffic; monitor the new play-funnel ratios daily.
2. If completion -> founder click is weak, A/B test post-match CTA text and button hierarchy by outcome (`winner` vs `loser`).
3. Add source-level split reporting inside play founder clicks (`neutral|winner|loser`) once enough events accrue.

## Autopilot Update — 00:43 ET
- Implemented source-level founder CTA performance split in `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` to close the highest-value measurement gap in play monetization:
  - Added explicit windowed click counters for `play-page-founder-cta-neutral`, `play-page-founder-cta-winner`, and `play-page-founder-cta-loser`.
  - Extended JSON rollup payload with `playFounderClicksBySource` and source-specific conversion/share rates.
  - Extended CLI output with a dedicated “Play founder clicks by source” section plus source-level conversion metrics.
- Validation:
  - `npm --prefix web run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix web run report:funnel -- --days=7` ✅

## Monetization Hypothesis
Per-source winner/loser/neutral click visibility will accelerate post-match CTA optimization by showing which emotional framing drives founder checkout intent most efficiently.

## Next Action
1. After deploy + traffic, compare winner vs loser source click share and promote the better-performing post-match CTA framing.
2. Add a guardrail alert if loser-share materially exceeds winner-share for 3 consecutive days (potential copy mismatch).
3. Use source winner as candidate copy seed for landing-page founder CTA test.

## Autopilot Update — 00:49 ET
- Implemented founder CTA copy experiment instrumentation on landing in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx` (highest-value conversion task from prior loop):
  - Added persistent 50/50 founder CTA variant assignment via `localStorage` key `cogcage_founder_cta_variant` (`reserve` vs `claim`).
  - Switched hero + footer founder buttons to dynamic copy (`Reserve Founder Spot` vs `Claim Founder Pricing`) while preserving existing founder flow.
  - Enriched founder funnel telemetry (`founder_checkout_clicked`, `founder_checkout_unavailable`) and founder-intent payload/source with `founderCtaVariant` for clean copy-level attribution.
  - Included founder CTA variant metadata on `landing_view` for easier cohort slicing.
- Validation: `npm --prefix web run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Copy-level testing on the highest-intent founder CTA will increase checkout click-through rate and reveal whether urgency language (“Claim Founder Pricing”) outperforms reservation framing.

## Next Action
1. Extend `web/scripts/funnel-rollup.mjs` to break out founder-click counts by CTA copy variant (`reserve` vs `claim`) across hero/footer sources.
2. After first traffic cohort, promote winning CTA copy globally and retire the loser variant.
3. If `claim` wins, mirror phrasing into nav/demo founder CTAs for consistency lift.
