## Objective
Continue revenue-first conversion optimization on the CogCage landing funnel.

## Autopilot Update — 00:03 ET
- Implemented top-of-funnel instrumentation and friction reduction in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `landing_view` event tracking on first render via `POST /api/events` for complete funnel visibility.
  - Added local email prefill from `localStorage` (`cogcage_email`) so returning visitors can convert with fewer keystrokes.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Improved first-visit attribution + reduced repeat form friction should increase measurable conversion from landing visit to founder checkout/waitlist submit.

## Autopilot Update — 00:08 ET
- Implemented a persistent 50/50 landing copy experiment in `web/src/components/CogCageLanding.jsx`:
  - Added `value` vs `competition` hero copy variants with localStorage assignment key `cogcage_copy_variant`.
  - Persisted variant across sessions and included it in funnel events (`landing_view`, `waitlist_joined`, `founder_checkout_clicked`) via top-level `variant` and `meta.variant`.
  - Tagged waitlist/founder sources with variant suffixes (`hero-waitlist-{variant}`, `hero-founder-cta-{variant}`) for simpler SQLite slicing.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Monetization Hypothesis
Variant-level messaging attribution will reveal whether value framing or competition framing drives higher founder CTA click-through and waitlist conversion, enabling faster copy optimization for revenue.

## Next Action
1. Launch a small outbound traffic burst and compare `founder_checkout_clicked` + `waitlist_joined` by variant over the first 100+ visits.
2. Promote the winning variant to default and iterate CTA button text as the next conversion lever.
