# Daily Log — 2026-02-25

## Objective
Initialize CogCage execution system for revenue-first operation.

## Shipped Today
- Created `ops/PEM_PLAN.md` (profit execution machine).
- Created `ops/OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` (task-selection and daily operating protocol).
- Established daily logging structure under `ops/logs/`.
- Chosen site direction: Option 1 visual style + Option 2 headline energy.

## Current Product Direction
- Brand/domain: CogCage / cogcage.com
- Frontend style: high-energy competitive sports-game presentation
- Hero messaging target: skill-based AI arena with payout potential

## KPI Snapshot
- Revenue today: $0
- MRR: $0
- Paid users: 0
- Runway note: bankroll intact ($1,000)

## Next 3 Tasks (money-first)
1. Ship launchable homepage with Join Alpha + email capture + Stripe-ready CTA path.
2. Define pricing + offer table (Founder/Pro/Tournament).
3. Implement first conversion event tracking (visit -> signup -> paid intent).

## Blockers
- None technical.
- Browser relay attachment intermittent (workaround: direct code iteration + user screenshots).

## Autopilot Update — 23:19 ET
- Implemented a conversion-focused landing page in `web/src/pages/index.astro` with:
  - High-energy hero + clear value proposition
  - Founder/Pro/Tournament pricing ladder
  - Primary conversion CTA (`Join Alpha`) and secondary plan CTA (`See Plans`)
  - Waitlist form wired to Formspree endpoint for immediate lead capture
  - Client-side event tracking (landing view, CTA clicks, waitlist submit) persisted in localStorage for early funnel validation
- Upgraded `web/src/layouts/Layout.astro` with SEO title/description props and improved global styling baseline.
- Validation: `npm run build` succeeds.

## Next Action
1. Replace Formspree with first-party `/api/waitlist` endpoint + SQLite/Sheet sink for owned lead data.
2. Add Stripe Checkout links for Founder plan pre-orders and track paid-intent clicks.
3. Stand up lightweight analytics endpoint/dashboard for conversion funnel visibility (visit → CTA → submit → checkout click).

## Autopilot Update — 23:24 ET
- Implemented direct monetization path for Founder conversions in `web/src/pages/index.astro`:
  - Added env-configurable checkout/waitlist URLs (`PUBLIC_STRIPE_FOUNDER_URL`, `PUBLIC_PRO_WAITLIST_URL`, `PUBLIC_TOURNAMENT_WAITLIST_URL`).
  - Upgraded Founder CTA to open Stripe checkout directly (new tracked event id: `founder_checkout_click`).
  - Added explicit `checkout_intent` tracking event when a checkout-tier CTA is clicked.
  - Updated waitlist copy to position checkout as immediate paid path.
- Documented revenue env configuration in `web/README.md`.
- Validation: `npm run build` passes.

## Next Action (Reprioritized)
1. Replace Formspree with first-party `/api/waitlist` endpoint + owned lead store (SQLite) so list ownership is internal.
2. Add a lightweight `/api/events` ingest endpoint to persist funnel events beyond localStorage.
3. Wire success redirect/thank-you page from checkout to capture paid conversion confirmation event.
