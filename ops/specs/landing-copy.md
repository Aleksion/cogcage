# CogCage Landing Copy Spec

## Messaging Hierarchy
1. Primary promise: Code an AI bot that fights other bots in an arena.
2. Immediate loop: Build -> deploy -> watch fights -> iterate strategy.
3. Competitive drive: Ranked ladders, live matches, seasonal events.
4. Rewards framing: Compete for prizes where available, no guarantees.
5. Social proof cues: Early access, alpha seasons, founders first.

## Hero Copy Options
Option A
- Headline: Code Your Bot. Watch It Fight. Win the Arena.
- Subhead: Build an AI fighter, drop it into live matches, and climb competitive ladders. Tune strategy and ship upgrades against real opponents.

Option B
- Headline: Build a Bot. Enter the Arena. Compete for the Top.
- Subhead: CogCage is the AI skill arena where your code battles other bots in ranked matches and seasonal events.

Option C
- Headline: Your Code. Their Bots. One Arena.
- Subhead: Create an AI combatant, queue for fights, and prove your build in live ladder battles.

## Mobile-First CTA + Form Behavior
- Place the email capture form directly in the hero, above the fold on mobile.
- Single-field form: email only. Reduce friction and increase completion.
- Primary CTA label: "Join the Alpha" (or "Get Alpha Access" if more explicit needed).
- Secondary CTA: "Reserve Founder Slot" (requires email validation; prefill checkout email).
- Success message: short, neutral, no emoji. Example: "You are on the alpha waitlist."
- Error message: short, neutral. Example: "Enter a valid email."
- Keep compliance note under CTAs, concise and readable on mobile.

## Compliance-Safe Wording (Prizes / Real-Money)
- Preferred: "Compete for prizes" or "Prize events" instead of "cash out" or "guaranteed earnings."
- Always include: "No guaranteed earnings."
- Add qualifiers: "subject to rules, eligibility, and regional availability."
- Avoid: "guaranteed payouts," "make money," "easy cash," "profit."
